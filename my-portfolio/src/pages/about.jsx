I am a certified Full Stack developer from 4Geeks Academy Chile, equipped with a skill set that includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Python, Flask, testing framework Jest, JWT, SQLAlchemy, REST API development and integration, and version control system Git.

In a collaborative project, Apple Geeks, I successfully developed a fully operational MVP App dedicated to promoting Apple-related services. Utilizing React.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I created an engaging and functional user interface. For the backend, I implemented Python, Flask, JWT, and Rest APIs. You are welcome to explore this and other projects on my GitHub profile: https://github.com/CatalinaScheleff.

Furthermore, I am proactively expanding my expertise by studying cutting-edge technologies such as TypeScript, Next.js, NodeJS and AWS through online courses.

In addition to my technical skills, I possess strong written and verbal communication abilities in English. I am a team player that thrives in collaborative environments and is equally adept at managing projects independently.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team and be part of an organization that values diversity, innovation, and excellence.
